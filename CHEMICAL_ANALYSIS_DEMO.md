- **High fructose corn syrup** (risk level: MEDIUM)
- **Artificial colors** (risk level: MEDIUM)
- **MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)** (risk level: LOW-MEDIUM)
- **BHA/BHT preservatives** (risk level: MEDIUM)
- **Sodium nitrites/nitrates** (risk level: HIGH)
- **Artificial sweeteners** (risk level: MEDIUM)

### 🧬 Food Additives Analysis
- **E-numbers identification** (E100-E1999)
- **Preservatives** (E200-E299)
- **Colorants** (E100-E199)
- **Flavor enhancers** (E600-E699)

### 🚫 Allergen Detection
- Common allergens (milk, eggs, nuts, gluten, soy, etc.)
- Severity assessment (MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE)
- Cross-contamination warnings

### 🌱 Safety Indicators
- **Organic certification** status
- **Artificial ingredients** detection
- **Overall safety score** (1-10 scale)

## How to Use

1. **Upload Image**: Take a clear photo of the ingredient list on food packaging
2. **AI Analysis**: Our enhanced Gemini AI will scan and analyze all visible ingredients
3. **Chemical Report**: Receive a detailed breakdown of:
   - Harmful chemicals with risk levels
   - Food additives with safety ratings
   - Allergen warnings
   - Overall safety assessment

## Safety Scoring System

- **🟢 8-10**: Very Safe (minimal to no harmful substances)
- **🟡 6-7**: Moderately Safe (some caution recommended)
- **🟠 4-5**: Potentially Harmful (avoid if sensitive)
- **🔴 1-3**: High Risk (significant health concerns)

## Example Analysis Output
